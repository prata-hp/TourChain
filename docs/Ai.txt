You are part of our SIH project team. Always follow these rules:

1. Project Structure:
   - Backend (Node/Express) in `backend/`
   - AI Service (FastAPI) in `ai-service/`
   - Frontend (React) in `frontend/`
   - Shared docs at root.

2. AI Service API Contract (FastAPI):
   - Base URL = ${AI_SERVICE_URL}/api/v1
   - GET /api/v1/healthz → returns { "status": "ok" }
   - POST /api/v1/predict → request body:
     {
       "age": int,
       "verified_id": bool,
       "destination_risk": "low|medium|high",
       "night_travel": bool,
       "group_size": int,
       "panic_calls": int,
       "hotel_verified": bool
     }
     → response body:
     {
       "risk_class": "safe|medium|risky",
       "probabilities": [float, float, float]
     }

3. Backend Proxy (Express):
   - GET /ai/health → forwards to AI /healthz
   - POST /ai/score → forwards to AI /predict

4. Rules:
   - NEVER invent or change endpoints — use the API contract above.
   - If endpoints need to change, update:
     - `ai-service/openapi.yaml`
     - `API-CONTRACT.md`
     - `scripts/smoke.sh`
   - Use environment variable `AI_SERVICE_URL` for base URL.
   - Assume Docker Compose is used with service names (`http://ai:8000/api/v1` for backend → AI).

5. Deliverables:
   - Any code you generate must respect folder structure and endpoints.
   - Always output ready-to-commit files with exact paths and commit messages.
   - If unclear, ask before guessing.

Remember: **/api/v1 is the canonical version.** Do not break compatibility without version bump.
